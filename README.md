### Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (40%)
#### Q1: Edge AI in Healthcare (Real-world impact)
We'll focus on healthcare, specifically a real-time application like patient monitoring in hospitals.
#### Q2: Quantum AI (Practical industry impacts - drug discovery)
We'll compare Quantum AI and classical AI in optimization problems and focus on the pharmaceutical industry.
#### Q3: Human-AI Collaboration (Job displacement and new roles in healthcare)
We'll discuss how AI can augment roles like radiologists and nurses, leading to new job opportunities.
#### Case Study: Smart Cities (Societal challenges)
We'll analyze the AI-IoT integration for traffic management and identify two societal challenges: data security and equity (digital divide).
### Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)
#### Task 1: Edge AI Prototype
- **Dataset**: TrashNet (recyclable items classification)
- **Environment**: Google Colab (simulation)
- **Model**: Basic CNN
- **Steps**:
  1. Train a CNN on TrashNet.
  2. Convert to TensorFlow Lite.
  3. Test and report accuracy.
  4. Explain benefits for real-time (e.g., reduced latency in recycling plants).
#### Task 2: Smart Agriculture Concept
- **General solution**: Crop yield prediction for multiple crops.
- **Sensors**: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, light, pH.
- **AI Model**: Regression (using sensor data to predict yield).
- **Diagram**: Use Python (Matplotlib) to sketch data flow.
#### Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine
- **Bias**: Socioeconomic data gaps (e.g., TCGA underrepresents low-income populations).
- **Fairness Strategy**: Systemic approaches (e.g., policy changes for diverse clinical trials, community engagement).
### Part 3: Futuristic Proposal (10%)
- **Application**: Personal AI for climate action (e.g., an app that optimizes individual carbon footprint).
- **Problem**: Climate change at the individual level.
- **Workflow**: Data inputs (user's consumption, travel), model (reinforcement learning to suggest actions).
- **Risks/Benefits**: Privacy vs. global impact.
### Bonus: Quantum Computing
- **Simulation**: Use IBM Quantum Experience (Qiskit) for a simple optimization problem (e.g., the traveling salesman problem) and explain how it could speed up drug discovery.
### Deliverables
1. **Code/Diagrams**:
   - Task 1: Colab notebook (with TFLite conversion and testing).
   - Task 2: Python script for diagram and 1-page proposal.
   - Bonus: Qiskit code in notebook.
2. **Written Report** (PDF) covering:
   - Part 1: Answers to essay questions and case study.
   - Part 2: Results of tasks (accuracy, diagram, bias analysis).
   - Part 3: Futuristic proposal.
3. **Presentation Deck**: A concise pitch (for business value) of the futuristic proposal.
### Next Steps
I will start generating the content and code. Let's begin with:
1. **Part 1: Theoretical Analysis** (written answers).
2. **Task 1: Edge AI Prototype** (code in Colab).
3. **Task 2: Smart Agriculture Concept** (diagram and proposal).
4. **Task 3: Ethics Analysis** (300 words).
5. **Part 3: Futuristic Proposal** (1-page).
6. **Bonus Task**: Quantum circuit.
