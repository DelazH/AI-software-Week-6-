Part 1: Theoretical Analysis
Q1: Edge AI in Healthcare
Real-world example: Wearable ECG monitors detecting atrial fibrillation in real-time.

Latency Reduction: On-device inference avoids cloud roundtrips (critical for stroke prevention)

Privacy Enhancement: Raw ECG data never leaves the device; only anonymized alerts are shared

Technical angle: Model quantization for ARM Cortex-M processors

Q2: Quantum AI in Drug Discovery

Aspect	Classical AI	Quantum AI
Optimization	Gradient descent (local minima traps)	Quantum annealing (global optimum)
Speed	O(n²) for molecular simulations	O(√n) with Grover's algorithm
Benefiting Industries:
Pharma: Accelerating protein folding simulations (e.g., Alzheimer's drug candidates)

Oncology: Optimizing radiation therapy plans in seconds vs. hours

Q3: Human-AI Collaboration in Radiology

Transformation: AI as "co-pilot" for tumor detection → radiologists shift to clinical decision architects

New Roles:

AI Validation Specialists: Audit false negatives in cancer screening

Patient Advocacy Coordinators: Explain AI diagnoses to vulnerable populations

Societal Impact: 30% faster diagnostics but requires HIPAA-compliant explainable AI

Case Study: AI-IoT Smart Traffic

Sustainability Gains:

Dynamic traffic light routing reduces idling emissions by 18% (Singapore case study)

Predictive maintenance of EV charging stations

Societal Challenges:

Data Weaponization: Hacktivists manipulating congestion data during emergencies

Access Inequality: Low-income districts receiving fewer sensors
